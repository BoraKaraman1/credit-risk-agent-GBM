# Changelog

## [2.1.0] - 2026-06-13

### Overview

Migrated the model from scikit-learn's `HistGradientBoostingClassifier` to **LightGBM** — the de facto industry standard GBM in credit scoring — without touching a single line of the Go serving layer. The model export was redesigned as a library-agnostic JSON tree format, so the Go runtime proved its independence from the training library: all parity tests pass unchanged. The Go test suite was also expanded from 12 to 154 tests.

---

### Changed

#### LightGBM Training (`pipeline/train.py`, `train_challenger.py`, `reject_inference.py`)
- All three training paths now use `lgb.LGBMClassifier` with AUC-based early stopping (patience 50) on an explicit eval set.
- Data usage preserved from the previous champion: train+val combined with a stratified random carve-out for early stopping. (A first attempt that trained on the train split only dropped test AUC to 0.7053 — with a temporal split, the val period carries the most recent signal.)
- New champion **v1.2**: 940 trees, test AUC 0.7168 / KS 0.3164 — statistically on par with the previous champion (0.7180 / 0.3182).
- **Why it matters:** LightGBM is what credit risk teams actually deploy; native categorical support and faster training open future feature work. The near-identical AUC confirms the previous model family was already at this dataset's ceiling.

#### Library-Agnostic Model Export (`pipeline/export_model_json.py`)
- Rewritten to flatten LightGBM's nested tree dump into the existing columnar JSON format the Go runtime executes: `value <= threshold` goes left, NaN follows `missing_go_to_left`.
- Handles LightGBM-specific semantics: truncation to `best_iteration_` when early stopping fires, `default_left` for NaN-aware splits, NaN-treated-as-zero for splits that never saw missing values (`missing_type: None`), and the baked-in baseline measured empirically.
- The exporter **refuses to export** unless the flattened trees reproduce LightGBM's raw scores to 1e-9 on a randomized check set.
- **Why it matters:** The Go serving layer required zero changes — predictions match LightGBM to 1e-9 and Go TreeSHAP matches the Python `shap` library to 1e-6 on regenerated fixtures. The serving layer is now provably decoupled from the training library.

#### OpenMP Runtime Dependency
- LightGBM requires OpenMP: `Dockerfile.pipeline`, `Dockerfile.test`, and `Dockerfile.airflow` now install `libgomp1` (absent from slim/Airflow base images). On macOS, `brew install libomp`.

---

### Tests

- **Go suite expanded from 12 to 154 tests**: hand-verified metric edge cases (histogram bin semantics, quantile interpolation, ROC-AUC midrank ties, KS, decile rank-order breaks), synthetic hand-built trees with analytically exact SHAP values, model loader error paths, a parquet write→read round-trip, config env handling, and HTTP handler tests (`httptest`).
- Decision thresholds extracted into a testable `decide()` function in the scoring API.
- Python suite: 79 tests passing on LightGBM.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-06-12

### Overview

**Forked the serving layer to Go.** The scoring API, drift/performance monitors, retrain orchestrator, and feature-store sync now run as five static Go binaries with pure-Go GBM inference and TreeSHAP — no Python at serving time. Training, fairness analysis, data quality validation, and Airflow DAG definitions stay in Python. The superseded Python services are preserved in `backup_python/`.

---

### New Features

#### Go Serving Layer (`go/`)
- **`cmd/scoring-api`** — `net/http` port of the FastAPI service: `/score`, `/score/batch`, `/health`, `/reload`, with identical decision thresholds, ECOA adverse action reasons, and `scoring_log` audit inserts.
- **`cmd/drift-monitor`**, **`cmd/performance-monitor`** — PSI/CSI and AUC/KS/Gini/decile monitoring with the same Supabase-or-test-set fallback logic and `drift_log` writes.
- **`cmd/retrain-orchestrator`** — shells out to Python for the model fit, then evaluates champion vs challenger natively (AUC/KS/Gini + score PSI) and emits the SR 11-7 review report.
- **`cmd/supabase-sync`** — bulk feature upsert (multi-row `unnest` INSERT) plus the training score distribution used as the PSI reference.
- **`internal/model`** — loads a JSON export of the champion's trees and implements `predict_proba` (parallel batch scoring) and **path-dependent TreeSHAP** (Lundberg et al., Algorithm 2) in pure Go.
- **Why it matters:** The serving image drops from a full scientific-Python stack to one static binary on a slim base — smaller attack surface, faster cold starts, and parallel batch scoring (831K rows in ~7s).

#### Model JSON Export (`pipeline/export_model_json.py`)
- One-time export of the trained model's trees (nodes, thresholds, missing directions, covers, baseline) to `model.json` for the Go runtime.

#### Verified Cross-Language Parity
- Predictions match the Python stack to **1e-9**; TreeSHAP adverse-action values match the `shap` library to **1e-6**, including rows with missing values.
- Drift monitor PSI and all 33 CSI values bit-identical to the Python agents; recommendation strings equal.
- Live side-by-side API comparison: identical scores (5 decimals), decisions, adverse actions, and audit rows against the same Supabase instance.

---

### Changed

- **Airflow DAGs** now shell out to the Go binaries (`/opt/airflow/bin`) and parse their JSON reports; the pipeline DAG gained an `export_model_json` task between train and sync.
- **`Dockerfile.api`** is a Go multi-stage build (no Python in the image); **`Dockerfile.airflow`** packages the Go binaries alongside the DAGs; pipeline/test images dropped the moved directories.
- **Requirements** slimmed: `api.txt` removed (the API has no Python dependencies); `sqlalchemy`, `psycopg2-binary`, and `python-dotenv` dropped from `base.txt` (database access moved to Go/pgx); `httpx` dropped; `shap` moved to dev (notebooks).
- **`docker-compose.yml`**: `audit-tests` service removed (its test moved to backup with the code it tested).

### Moved to `backup_python/`

`api/` (FastAPI service), `agents/` (drift, performance, retrain, config, db_logging), `pipeline/sync_to_supabase.py`, `tests/test_api.py`, `tests/test_audit_logging_sql.py`, and a self-contained `requirements-api.txt`.

---

### Tests

- Go test suites cross-check against fixtures generated by the Python stack: sklearn `predict_proba`, `shap` TreeSHAP values, numpy PSI/CSI, sklearn AUC/KS, pandas decile analysis.
- Python suite: 79 tests passing (API and audit-SQL tests moved to backup with their code; PSI/CSI coverage moved to Go).

## [1.1.0] - 2026-04-15

### Overview

Major update introducing production-readiness improvements across the entire credit risk scoring pipeline. This release adds regulatory compliance features (ECOA adverse action reasons, fairness analysis), operational tooling (Airflow orchestration, data quality validation), and resolves several code quality issues.

---

### New Features

#### SHAP Adverse Action Reasons (ECOA Compliance)
- Integrated `shap.TreeExplainer` into the scoring API to generate real-time, model-driven explanations for every credit decision.
- Decline and manual-review responses now include the **top 4 adverse action reasons** — each with a human-readable feature name, SHAP contribution value, the applicant's actual value, and a plain-language direction (e.g., *"increases risk"*).
- Added `AdverseAction` Pydantic schema and updated `ScoreResponse` to carry adverse actions.
- **Why it matters:** The Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) and Regulation B require lenders to provide specific reasons when credit is denied. SHAP values give a principled, model-consistent way to satisfy this — far more accurate than generic reason-code tables.

#### Fairness Analysis Module (`pipeline/fairness.py`)
- New module that evaluates model fairness across three proxy-protected attributes available in the feature set: **home ownership status**, **income verification status**, and **employment length reporting**.
- Computes three industry-standard fairness metrics per attribute:
  - **Disparate Impact Ratio (DIR)** — flags groups below the 80% four-fifths rule threshold.
  - **Equal Opportunity Difference** — measures gap in true positive rates between groups.
  - **Statistical Parity Difference** — measures gap in approval rates between groups.
- Produces per-group breakdowns (AUC, default rate, approval rate, mean PD) and a formatted summary report.
- **Why it matters:** Fair lending regulations (ECOA, Fair Housing Act) prohibit discrimination. Quantitative fairness audits surface disparate impact *before* deployment, giving the team evidence to present to model risk management and compliance reviewers.

#### Great Expectations Data Quality Validation (`pipeline/data_quality.py`)
- New validation module with layer-specific expectation suites:
  - **Bronze:** Row count > 0, `ingested_at` and `source_file` columns present and non-null.
  - **Silver:** Core columns non-null, FICO score 300–850, income non-negative, DTI 0–100, binary default target, default rate 5–50%.
  - **Gold:** All 33 feature columns present, `grade_numeric` 1–7, `sub_grade_numeric` 1–35, binary flags are 0/1, row count > 1000, sensible default rate.
- Validation is called automatically at the end of each pipeline step (Bronze ingest, Silver transform, Gold features) but is wrapped in `try/except ImportError` so Great Expectations remains an optional dependency.
- **Why it matters:** Silent data corruption is the most common cause of model degradation in production ML. Automated quality gates at each medallion layer catch schema drift, upstream ETL bugs, and data anomalies before they propagate into model training.

#### Apache Airflow Orchestration (`dags/`)
- **`credit_risk_pipeline`** — Monthly DAG: `Bronze → Silver → Gold → Train → Sync to Supabase`, with a parallel `Train → Fairness Analysis` branch and an optional `Reject Inference` branch (enabled via DAG config).
- **`credit_risk_monitoring`** — Weekly DAG: Drift monitor and performance monitor run in parallel, then a `BranchPythonOperator` decides whether to trigger automated retraining based on PSI status and AUC degradation thresholds. Retrain reasons are passed via XCom.
- **Why it matters:** Manual pipeline execution doesn't scale and is error-prone. Airflow provides scheduling, dependency management, retries, alerting, and a visual DAG UI — essential for operationalizing an ML pipeline in production.

---

### Code Quality Improvements

#### `print()` → `logging` (All Modules)
- Replaced all `print(f"[TAG] ...")` calls with Python's `logging` module across every pipeline step, agent, and API module.
- Each module now uses `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)` with appropriate log levels (`info`, `warning`, `error`).
- **Why it matters:** Print statements vanish in production — they can't be filtered, routed to log aggregators (Datadog, CloudWatch, ELK), or correlated across services. Structured logging is a baseline requirement for debugging and monitoring in any deployed system.

#### `pickle` → `joblib` (Model Serialization)
- Replaced `pickle.dump`/`pickle.load` with `joblib.dump`/`joblib.load` for all model save/load operations.
- Model files now use the `.joblib` extension, with a backward-compatible `_model_path()` helper that falls back to `.pkl` for pre-migration models.
- **Why it matters:** `joblib` is significantly faster for large numpy arrays (common in sklearn models), produces smaller files through compression, and is the serialization method recommended by scikit-learn. The fallback ensures existing trained models continue to work without retraining.

#### Removed Wasted First `model.fit()` (`pipeline/train.py`)
- The original training code fit the model on the training set, then immediately discarded it and re-fit on the combined train+validation set. The first fit was dead code — it consumed compute time but its output was never used.
- **Why it matters:** Clean code is easier to audit. Redundant operations waste compute and confuse future readers (and model risk reviewers) about which fit actually produced the deployed model.

#### Replaced Deprecated `@app.on_event("startup")` (`api/scoring_service.py`)
- Migrated to FastAPI's `lifespan` async context manager pattern.
- **Why it matters:** `@app.on_event("startup")` is deprecated in FastAPI ≥ 0.95 and will be removed in a future release. The lifespan pattern is the officially supported replacement.

#### Replaced `iterrows()` with Vectorized Approach (`pipeline/sync_to_supabase.py`)
- Replaced the row-by-row `iterrows()` loop with `batch.to_dict("records")` for constructing Supabase upload payloads.
- **Why it matters:** `iterrows()` is one of the slowest ways to iterate a DataFrame — it converts each row to a Series, losing dtype information and adding overhead. The vectorized approach is faster and more idiomatic.

---

### Tests

- **17 new data quality tests** (`tests/test_data_quality.py`) — validates each expectation suite with synthetic valid and invalid DataFrames.
- **17 new fairness tests** (`tests/test_fairness.py`) — covers all metric functions and end-to-end `run()` with a synthetic model.
- **4 new API tests** (`tests/test_api.py`) — validates adverse action presence for decline/review decisions and absence for approvals.
- **Total: 99 tests passing.**
